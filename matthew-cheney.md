While I haven't played EVE Online, I have played a similar game, and I'm interested in the economies of multi-player games.

For the business side, I have done open-source projects before, and am a big fan of the paradigm.

On the legal side, I agree that there shouldn't be any legal issues (assuming the game doesn't add any rules against an app like this).

For the technical part, I have consumed apis in multiple languages, and so I can be helpful there. I have also worked with AngularJS, which I imagine is similar to regular Angular.
