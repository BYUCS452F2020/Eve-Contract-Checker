Ok this would be a pretty neat application. I have played EVE Online and found some aspects of the game confusing. An applicaion like this would be pretty useful to keep track of different aspects of the game. I have been interested in learning some Angular frontend, but I would be pretty helpful with the Java backend. I know there are a lot of EVE Online services that are free and others that are not. Allowinig people to use this service for free would help them to get into the game and do better. I see no particular legal issues with this. The technical specs work out really nicely, the angular part allows for easy web and app development.
